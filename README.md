Simple exercises to learn shortcuts
--

You want to be more efficient in your everyday work? 
You know there are shortcuts, but you can never remember them?
Let's practice together and discover new tricks to program faster. 
Available languages: .net, java, kotlin, typescript and python.

In each language, some tests invite you to manipulate code with shortcuts.

Exercices are guided for IntelliJ & Visual Studio Resharper, 
but nothing prevents you from doing them with your favorite IDE.

Dear visual studio users, install the [IntelliJ IDEA Keybindings](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings)
plugin to be guided in most of proposed exercices. 

# Setup

Open with your IDE the directory of the langage you choose.
![⚠️ Open the right folder](setup.png)

Start with koan basic and let yourself be guided.
Gradually, make the tests pass to green.

Have fun!
